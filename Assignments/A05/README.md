## Assignment 5 - Graphviz FamilyTree
#### Due: 06-12-2023 (Monday @ 10:10 a.m.)

### Overview

Using family tree data that you auto generate (in whatever method you can) create a graphviz `dot` file that will create a hierarchical view of the data. The image below is a loose example of what yours could look like. I would like more detail in each record about the person, however.

Here is a stack overflow article that might be some help with generating the dot code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2271704/family-tree-layout-with-dot-graphviz

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A05` to place your assignment files in. 
- You should have the following files:
     `family_tree.dot`
  - python code to generate the family tree data 
  - python code to create the `dot` file
  - the output image from your `dot` code and name it `family_tree.png` (or jpg or svg or whatever image format its in).
  - a file called `data.csv` (or `json`) that contains the family tree data you are using to make the tree.
- Look [HERE](../../Resources/01-Readmees/README.md) for information on creating good README's for your projects.
