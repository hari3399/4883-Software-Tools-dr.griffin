## Assignment 6 - Software Tool Presentation
#### Due: TBD

### In General

Every student in this course will present a software tool of their choice. A `Software Tool` is a subjective topic to be sure. For the purposes of this course, I define a software tool as something that streamlines or simplifies the development process. Which as you can imagine is an extremely wide open definition. I want your tool to be something that adds productivity to the programming process, which differs depending on the problems being solved. A `software tool` is not a programming language or an IDE but is more like an **`Add On`** ... like a plugin, a library, or a framework of sorts. 

For example, if I were coding for micro-devices vs micro-services and I wanted to use a container based deployment for scaling vs embedded code on a single device, my tools would be very very different according to those two topics. Some tools may overlap. Many won't. This summer course is about introducing possibilities, showing you what's available,  and improving everyone's workflow no matter what. I think everyone of you will learn something helpful.

### Assignment Overview

In assignment [A03](../A06/README.md) I had you choose a tool to discuss with the class. I will talk to each student before I approve their actual presentation of said tool. So, if you find yourself scheduled to present, and you haven't talked to me, you better reach out and make sure I approve your presentation. Having said that, you can also change your tool if you find something more interesting or appropriate after you did [A03](../A06/README.md).

The idea is to present a tool to the class, in a 15-30 minute presentation, explaining how and why you feel that that particular tool could improve someones workflow. You should base your discussion on a few core topics:
    - the major topic (cloud, ide plugin, server, AI, console, etc.)
    - relevance (describe why this is relevant to the class, or how it will build their resume`)
    - background (if it as advanced topic, you need to give background and bring class up to speed)
    - examples (show examples of your tool and its productivity)
