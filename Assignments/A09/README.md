## Assignment 9 - Grading Presentations

#### Due: Multiple Dates

### Overview:

It seems you (as a class) are not taking the grading portion of the presentations very seriously. The problem is that I take it very seriously. I have amended the grade distribution to make assessing your fellow students worth 5% of your overall grade. I expect grades to be entered expediently. I will be tracking who and who does not enter grades in a timely fashion.

Remember, I won't divulge your grades to anyone, not even professors. But I expect you to be fair, and not inflate grades for you friends, or deflate grades for mortal enemy's. I don't need a statistical analysis tool or an AI to discover this treachery, **it just stands out when it happens**.

### Helper Criteria

If you are having trouble determining your "grade" for another student, here are some criteria ordered by importance:

1. Were they prepared?
   - This should be obvious depending on what their topic is.
2. Was the presentation organized?
   - Again, it should be broken into logical components so we all can follow.
3. Did they appear to have practiced?
4. Did the communicate their points to the class very well (this is a by product of preparation and practice)
   - I want to stress to all of you that I understand there is a language issue sometimes, and I very much will take this into consideration when some of you present. I could not imagine having to give a presentation in `Hindi` or `Bengali` so I respect all of you that are using English as a second language. But regardless of language barrier, it will still be obvious if you are prepared or not.
5. Did you think their tool was cool? or useful?
6. Is the tool practical?

### Summary

- There are 27 students
- I should have 26 assessments for each.
- As of the printing of this document we have completed 6 presentations.
- There should be 156 entries (6 \* 26 = 156 )
- There are currently 46
- See the problem?
