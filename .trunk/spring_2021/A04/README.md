## Intro to Sql - NFL Stat Mining using Sql
### Due: Friday, February 29<sup>th</sup> by classtime.

### Overview

Processing `json` files can be tedious work, especially large complex ones. Another software tool that can make the task of aggregating data much much easier is `SQL`. This is not a database class, but running some simple queries is not beyond the scope of our skills. 

The questions below are the same questions I asked you to calculate processing your 2000+ `json` files we acquired from the NFL. Lets see how much easier it can be if we use `SQL` to get it done. 

### VSCode

#### Requirements 

**Q1**
- Count number of teams an individual player played for.
- Limit your output to the top 10 players that played for the most teams.
- Output

```
Teams played for:

#     PlayerID      Name          # Teams
=========================================
1     00-00001234   D. Smith         #
2         ''           ''            ''
3         ''           ''            ''
```

**Q2**
- Find the players with the highest total rushing yards by year, and limit the result to top 5.
- This means to sum up all players rushing yards per year, and list the top 5 (most yards) in your output.
- Output

```
Top 5 rushing players:

#     PlayerID      Name        Year    # Yards
================================================

================================================
1     00-00001234   D. Xxxx     2018      ####
