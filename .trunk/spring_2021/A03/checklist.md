|   3.1   | Nfl game id's were scraped from NFL.com.                              |         |        |
|   3.2   | Used python beautifual soup or similar library.                       |         |        |
|   3.3   | Game ids should be saved somewhere and shouldn't be coupled w/        |         |        |
|         | the Json scraping code (unless game ids and json are all              |         |        |

|   4.2   | Used Python `requests` or some `urllib` to obtain files.              |         |        |
|   4.3   | Obtaining of files shouldn't be coupled with game ids unless (again)  |         |        |
|         | one file saves both sets locally in one go.                           |         |        |

|   5.1   | Calculation of results should be done after data is obtained working  |         |        |
|         | with a local set of json files.                                       |         |        |
|   5.2   | Output was nicely formatted and easy to read.                         |         |        |
